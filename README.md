# Basic Matrix Operations

The following matrix operations package was developed for use in a university scientific computing class. The package was developed to provide functionality for creating matrix objects of any dimension and performing common matrix operations upon them. The culminating effort of this project was a naive Baye's classification function which allows fast and accurate classification of data sets in any dimension. Additionaly the project provides the ability to calculate eigen-values and eigen-vectors and the characteristic polynomial of high-degree polynomials.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Python v 3.4 or higher.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
